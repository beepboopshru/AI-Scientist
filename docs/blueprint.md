# **App Name**: LawFinder AI

## Core Features:

- Hypothesis Generation: Use a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel scientific hypotheses based on a knowledge graph of physics literature from sources like arXiv, taking into account existing theories and experimental data. The LLM acts as a tool, suggesting potential new avenues for scientific exploration.
- Equation Derivation: Implement symbolic regression algorithms (e.g., PySR) to derive candidate equations from the AI-generated hypotheses by fitting them to available experimental data.
- Results Display: Display equations, and other metrics for review, like accuracy against known benchmarks.
- Interactive Interface: Create an interface that allows researchers to inspect and analyze the AI-generated equations.
- Link to Code: Provide a clear, easily navigable link to the project's GitHub repository, as provided by the scientists.  The link is: [GitHub Repository Link]

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #78B9B5, a muted teal evoking intellect and calmness.
- Background color: Very light teal (a lighter shade of #78B9B5), provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, focusing attention on content.
- Accent color: #008080, a darker teal to draw attention to interactive elements and key findings. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font to ensure readability and to maintain a clean, modern aesthetic appropriate for scientific content.
- Use clear, simple icons for navigation, equation representation and data visualization.
- Use a grid-based layout for presenting equations and other related metrics.
