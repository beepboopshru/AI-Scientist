##  About the Project

This repository houses a prototype of an **AI-assisted physicist**—an innovative system that generates, tests, and refines physical laws autonomously. By integrating symbolic regression, simulations, LLMs, and knowledge graphs into a closed-loop pipeline, it aims to accelerate scientific discovery.

##  Motivation

Traditional discovery in physics can be slow and labor-intensive. Our project envisions an AI system that:

- Learns from physics literature and experimental data  
- Proposes novel hypotheses in human-readable form  
- Converts these into equations using symbolic regression  
- Validates them through simulations  
- Refines its understanding iteratively via reinforcement learning

##  Architecture Overview

![System Architecture](docs/architecture_diagram.png)

1. **Knowledge Base**: Combines physics literature, experimental data (e.g., CERN, NASA), simulated datasets, all stored in a Neo4j-based knowledge graph with Semantic Vector embeddings (Weaviate + SciBERT).  
2. **Hypothesis Engine**: Uses a fine-tuned LLM to propose hypotheses. PySR handles symbolic regression to convert these into testable equations.  
3. **Simulation & Validation Lab**: Runs equations through COMSOL, Qiskit, etc., and compares results with real-world data for validation.
